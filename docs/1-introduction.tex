\section{Context}

Nowadays, it is common to interact with business to request services such as technical attention or responses with advise using their products. Interacting in social networks such as Twitter or Facebook is a familiar way to users to get in touch with the support they need. For example, telecommunication service providers such as Movistar or Orange can be reached quickly by writing a message in a social media, instead of a complicated and usually longer telephonic conversation. In these situations, getting a fast response can mean the difference between a happy customer or losing it.

In this scenario, is desirable automatizing as much as possible to offer a quick response and save costs. To do this and offer a person-like behavior, a common solution is deploying a chatbot. This way, the service provider can give the user a way of getting the information needed in a friendly environment.
